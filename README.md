## Project Description
This project uses Python and the Pandas library to create a funnel, tracking user activity from the home page through to the 'purchased' page, for Cool T-Shirts Inc's website - a website where users can go to buy cool t-shirts - in order to determine the weakest parts of the website. The purpose of this project is to showcase the author's proficiency in Python programming and their use of the Pandas library to complete a range of tasks. These tasks include merging datasets, conducting basic data analysis, and writing essential queries using the Pandas library to efficiently sort and filter data.

## Features
   - Creation of a website funnel
     - Done by using the Pandas library's merge function to left-merge the various datasets used (visits.csv, cart.csv, etc) in order to see which users moved on to the next step in the checkout process and which did not.
   - Basic data analysis on the funnel
     - Done by using tools within the Pandas library such as the Dataframe object and its associated member functions
     - As well as using various functions within Python's 'Math' library
